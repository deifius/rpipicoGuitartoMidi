Raspberry Pi Pico Guitar Pitch Detection
This project utilizes the Raspberry Pi Pico to analyze the pitch of a guitar with active piezo pickups and send corresponding MIDI messages. The detected pitch is converted into MIDI Note On, Note Off, Pitch Bend, and Aftertouch messages, allowing for expressive control over other MIDI devices or software.

Components
Raspberry Pi Pico: Microcontroller running MicroPython.
Guitar with Active Piezo Pickups: Source of the audio signal.
Resistors: 10kΩ (2x) for signal conditioning.
Capacitor: 1μF non-polarized for AC coupling.
Operational Amplifier (Optional): Buffer stage (e.g., Texas Instruments' TLV9061).
Prototyping Board/Breadboard and Wires: For connecting components.
Circuit Diagram
The guitar signal is conditioned using a resistor-capacitor (RC) high-pass filter and a DC biasing circuit. An optional op-amp buffer can be used to match impedance.

Setup and Usage
Connect the Components: Follow the circuit diagram to connect the guitar to the Raspberry Pi Pico's ADC.
Install MicroPython: Ensure that the Pico is running MicroPython.
Load the Code: Copy the main script and the midi_methods.py file to the Pico.
Run the Script: Execute the main script to begin pitch detection.
Connect to MIDI Device: Use the UART pins on the Pico to connect to a MIDI device or interface.
Functionality
Pitch Detection: Analyzes the guitar's pitch using FFT.
MIDI Conversion: Maps detected pitch to MIDI note numbers.
Note On/Off Handling: Sends Note On/Off messages based on pitch and amplitude.
Pitch Bend: Implements pitch bend based on fine pitch variations.
Aftertouch Dynamics: Employs aftertouch for master volume control.
Customization
Modify constants and functions within the code to tailor the behavior to your specific guitar, pickups, and desired MIDI functionality.
